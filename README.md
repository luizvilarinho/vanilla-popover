# JAVASCRIPT VANILLA POPOVER

The idea is to do an alternate version of Bootstrap Popover with a minimum vanilla Javascript code and CSS.

The project was started by Luiz Vilarinho [1] and Alex Novelli [2].

Thanks to Alireza Sarabchi [3] for FadeIn & fadeOut Vanilla function.

Thanks to Freepik for the Doubt Icon [4]

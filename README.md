# JAVASCRIPT VANILLA POPOVER

The idea is to do an alternate version of Bootstrap Popover with a minimum vanilla Javascript code and CSS.

The project was started by [Luiz Vilarinho](https://github.com/luizvilarinho) and [Alex Novelli](https://github.com/alexnovelli).

Thanks to [Alireza Sarabchi](https://github.com/alirezas) for [FadeIn & fadeOut Vanilla](https://gist.github.com/alirezas/c4f9f43e9fe1abba9a4824dd6fc60a55) script.
